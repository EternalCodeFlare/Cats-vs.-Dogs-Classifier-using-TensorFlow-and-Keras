# Cats-vs.-Dogs-Classifier-using-TensorFlow

This repo contains the ***Machine Learning models for Cats vs. Dogs classifier***. The project uses ***TensorFlow*** along with ***Keras*** to extract the features using various the ***Cats and Dogs dataset from Kaggle*** that is freely available. I am using ***Google Colab*** for working on this project that gives us the power to train the ML models using GPUs for faster training. Basic understanding of CNNs is required for understanding the code of this model. 

I started this project with a basic model with almost 70% accuracy over the test images and then will gradually improve the accuracy with each new model and new techniques.

This project deals with improving the results of the models that have been developed using some techniques like Image Augmentation. All the accuracy can mostly be measured using the loss vs. epochs graphs and also the accuracy vs. epochs.
